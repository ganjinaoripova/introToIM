***Computer Graphics Art***

For this assignment we were supposed to create a compuer generative art. I took inspiration from the following pieces

I decided to make something similar to this yet at the same time different. I was adding different squares on top of each other, and luckily they came up pretty good.

At first when you see the piece it looks very simple, however it was very time consuming since I am still new to processing, however luckily I didnt encounter any big challenges while working on this project. Even it was time consuming I enjoyed working on it, designing part and also making different size of boxes that would go together
