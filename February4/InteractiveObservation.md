**Interactive Observation**

INSTAGRAM

I would like to talk about Instagram stickers and new features that are very interactive. I am sure over half of NYUAD students use Instagram today. Instagram allows users to interact with each other by posting photos/videos, liking and commenting, following accounts and sharing posts. 
Instagram developed some new features a couple of months ago, asking and answering questions, poll and vote stickers, effects that show questions automatically where you need to answer to them. Just a simple interaction between people on Instagram is commenting on photos/videos and replying to stories. 

Question Stickers:
Ask Me Anything - is the new instagram feature, where you can post a photo on your story and put that Question Sticker by writing some questions or by simply saying ask me what you want. When people watch your story they can then tap a sticker and ask you a question. After reading all the question you can choose which one to post and answer on your story. It’s a very fun feature, where people interact with each other and get to know more about you. 


Poll stickers:
With putting poll stickers on your stories, you can ask for help from people and simply make your decision choice way more easier.As an example if you are in the store and saw two phones, however don’t know which one to get, you can take a photo of both of them, post it on your story and ask people’s opinion. And people can react to your poll by pressing either left or right side of the poll.


However, the constraints of Instagram’s feature is that the interactions are synchronous, meaning that responses are delayed. Since, typing and commenting takes more time than talking with a person in real life. Or people reading comments, since sometimes there can be tons of comments under the photo/video.
