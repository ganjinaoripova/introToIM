***Corona Timeeeee***

For our final project, we had to create anything on Processing. Since we could do anything, I had a lot of ideas in mind at the beginning but finally I decided that i want to do something related to Covid-19. I decided to make a game in which I wanted to show how important and dangerous is this virus is, however at the same time make it interesting and fun.
