***"CORONA" - shooting game***

For our final project, we had to create anything on Processing. Since we could do anything, I thought of making something related to Covid-19. I decided to make a game in which I wanted to show how important and dangerous this virus is, however, at the same time make it interesting and fun. 

### Initial idea

This is the idea that I had at the beginning, however when I started coding, I changed the idea a bit. Instead of spreading the toilet paper and saving people, I decided to make a similar game to shooting game.

 Explanation:   
 - Player can move only left or right with moving the mouse 
 - When the player presses the mouse -> start shooting enemies, however, when the mouse is not pressed -> player just stays in its position 
- Enemies start coming automatically/randomly when the game begins
- Player can shoot enemies with bullets and to make it more difficult I decided to give bullets to enemies as well so they could shoot
 - When the player shoots the enemy -> enemy automatically disappears but still the bullets come down 
 - When you shoot the enemy - one second automatically be added into the count up timer 
 - I didnt want the game to be simple, so in order to make it even more harder, I decided to lives as well, so the player has 5lives -> when the enemy shoots the player - minus one live
 - In order to make the game engaging and interesting to play, I decided to add a score button
 - Count up time - in total 30 seconds -> when the timer reaches 10 seconds -> the color of the timer and the score becomes red to notify the player that the game will end soon 
 
Challenging  Part: 
- Writing a code for GameOver screen, was very time consuming since, it kept showing the GameOver screen only once at the beginning, and when you play the game for the second time, it automatically kept restarting it without even showing the screen.  After the meeting with professor, the issue was resolved.
 - Problems with "lives": whenever enemy shoots the player -> one live less. Making it the way so when the enemy shoots the player -> minus one live, was also hard, since my code didnt work, however after watching youtube tutorials I figured out.
