***Self-Portrait***
 
For this project we had to make a self portrait which didn't have to be dynamic using Processing and I decided to make a portrait of myself.

I have never used processing before and it was very challenging at first, since I didnt know where to start from and how to manage things. It was also very time consuming and I have spent a lot of time trying to put all the things together and changing every single value. 

Although the process was very time consuming I really enjoyed working on it, since it really helped me to learn making different shapes and how to put things together. I am very pleased with the end result and I think that I have somewhat accomplished the goal of making a portrait of myself.
