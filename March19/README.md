***self portrait***
 
For this project we had to make a self portrait which didnt have to be dynamic using Processing and I tried to make an image of myself.
I have never used processing before and it was very challenging at first, since I didnt know where to start from and how to manage things. It was also very time consuming and I have spent a lot of time trying to put all the things together and changing every single value. 
Although it the process was very nerve wrecking I am very pleased with the end result and I think that I have somewhat accomplished the goal of making a portrait of myself. 

Here is the image of the self-portrait
