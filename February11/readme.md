** circuit with Arduino that combines multiple digital inputs and outputs **

For this assignment I  decided to use photoresistor and button to control LED. I used two LEDâ€™s for button and one LED for photoresistor. When you press the button the LED's start blinking one after each other, I kind of wanted to use the ambulance/police lights vibes, where they blink one by one. 

Fro my other LED, I used photoresistor to control it. When there is light the LED turns on and when you cover photoresistor the LED turns off. You can find the video below, of the LED's and how they react while using photresistor and button. 

Here is the schematic of my circuit

I guess the challenging part was writing a code in Arduino since at the beginning I was very confused by all the things I was doing, however, after going one by one and googling the meaning of each code, I kind of figured out the logic behind it.
